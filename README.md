# DeskWatch

DeskWatch is an ESP32-S3 desk status panel. When idle it rotates through server stats, open pull requests and pipeline status. When a CI job runs it switches to live progress, shows a red alert on failure (cleared with a button) and a short green flash on success.

## How it fits together

- **Bridge** (Rust, runs on a Debian home server): collects server stats, receives Gitea and GitHub webhooks, polls Azure DevOps, decides what the panel should show and publishes it over MQTT.
- **Firmware** (Rust, esp-hal + embassy): a deliberately dumb MQTT client on an ESP32-S3 SuperMini with a 4" ST7796S touch screen. It draws whatever page the bridge sends.
- **MQTT** (Mosquitto) sits between the two.

## Design docs

The design lives in the project's shared files for now:

- `mqtt-schema.md`: the MQTT contract between bridge and panel
- `schema-and-wiring.md`: hardware and pin wiring
- `firmware-stack.md`: firmware crate choices
- `display-options.md`: display research

## Status

The bridge skeleton is in `bridge/`: it publishes the server stats page every 5 seconds, with retained
state and online/offline status topics. CI sources (Gitea first, then GitHub and Azure DevOps) come next,
followed by a firmware spike once the screen arrives.

## Running the bridge

Needs a stable Rust toolchain and a Mosquitto broker.

```sh
cargo run -p deskwatch-bridge -- bridge/config.example.toml
mosquitto_sub -t 'deskpanel/#' -v   # in another terminal
```

The config path can also come from `DESKWATCH_CONFIG`; the default is `/etc/deskwatch/bridge.toml`. The MQTT
password, if any, is read from `DESKWATCH_MQTT_PASSWORD`. A sample systemd unit is in
[deploy/deskwatch-bridge.service](deploy/deskwatch-bridge.service).
